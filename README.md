#### ABOUT
## What is the repository all about?
The plan with this repo is to store all my notes from this course, each module or section can be found under its own `.md` file.

## What can you expect from this repository?
All of my notes will be stored within a `.md` file under each respective folder. I would glady make a site and place all my notes there once the course is completed and I have gained insight into React. 

If a visual example is needed, I would most likely use <a href="https://codepen.io/trending">CodePen</a> for quick demonstrations, and for full projects they will have their own repository with a link pointing to that repository and live version, which is either hosted here on GitHub Pages or Netlify depending on the project needs.
